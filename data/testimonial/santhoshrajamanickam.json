  "content": "I had the pleasure of working with Jan-Marten at Slimmer, where he was my tech lead—and I couldn’t have asked for a better mentor and teammate.\n\nJan-Marten has a remarkable ability to stay calm and focused under pressure, guiding the team with a steady hand even in the most challenging situations. I learned a great deal from him—not just technically, but also in how to approach problems thoughtfully and collaboratively.\n\nWhat I appreciate most is that Jan-Marten is never condescending when helping others. He’s approachable, always willing to lend a hand, and genuinely cares about the growth of those around him. His strong work ethic is inspiring, and he still manages to keep things fun and light-hearted.\n\nI’m truly grateful to have worked with Jan-Marten and would gladly do so again. Anyone would be lucky to have him on their team.",
