  "content": "Jan-Marten is the best of both worlds. Highly skilled, technically flexible engineers that stay cool and creative under pressure are alone hard to come by. But match that with his deeply empathetic, communicative, up-lifting leadership? That is unicorn gold. JM’s decisions reflect not just what’s possible, but what’s principled. He builds high-trust, high-autonomy environments where engineers thrive. I would - and I will - hire him again and again, given the chance."
